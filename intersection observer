Instersection observer  is an API that is used to detect the interaction of a target element with itsâ€™s ancestor element or the document viewport.

how to implement intersection Observer..

1) create the instace of inserction observer....

  const observer = new intersectionobsever(callback,options)

2) we pass a callback fun and options to the instace of observer,,

3) callback: (entries,observer)=>{
      // entries are list of obseervers that have been intersected with the target element and vieport
      we need loop for each entry which is an object that as properties like isIntersectin
      // and observer learn in future and commit
}

code snippet:::

const observer = new IntersectionObserver( (entries)=>{
    entries.forEach((entry)=>{
        console.log(entry.isIntersecting)
        if(entry.isIntersecting){
            entry.target.classList.add("inverse")}
        else{
            entry.target.classList.remove("inverse")
        }
    })
}, {
    root: null, 
    // threshold: 0.25, 
    rootMargin: "-225px 0px -225px 0px" 
})
